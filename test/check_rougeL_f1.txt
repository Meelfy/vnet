A triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three to four fatty acids (from tri-and glyceride). Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.

This estimate indicates what you are eligible for, based on the information you provided, not your actual FAFSA money. FAFSA may indicate that you are eligible for a Pell grant in a certain amount, for example. Your financial aid award is determined by the school you will be attending and their financial aid offices. While FAFSA could estimate $2,000 per semester for the above-mentioned grant, your university may only approve $1,500 of this. The same principle applies to all other government grants and loans. In turn, you will receive another document, this time from your universityâs financial aid office, which outlines what you will receive in aid, should you accept it.

The tri-shield insignia with distinctive, diagonally arranged red, white and blue shields, was widely introduced in 1960 and was featured front-and-center in the grilles of the LeSabre, Electra and Invicta models. The three-model lineup inspired the three shields in the new design. Each carried over the stag head and gold cross cues from the previous single-shield design. As with the original shield design, the tri-shield design evolved. By the early 1970s, a ring motif surrounded the shields and the white color of one of the shields changed to silver. By the late 1970s, the tri-shield was used primarily on hood ornaments on some models, while the symbol of a hawk on the Buick name was used as the official logo, particularly in print and television advertising.
